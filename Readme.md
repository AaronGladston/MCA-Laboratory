## Commit Message Guidelines

To maintain a consistent and readable history of changes, please follow these commit message conventions:

### 1. **Commit Message Structure**:
- **type**: A short descriptor of the commit (e.g., `fix`, `feature`, `docs`, `refactor`, etc.).
- **scope**: A general label for the part of the project affected (e.g., `web`, `python`, `datastructures`, etc.). This part is optional but recommended for better clarity.
- **message**: A brief explanation of the changes made.

### 2. **Commit Types**:
- **feat**: A new feature added (e.g., `feat(web): added contact form`).
- **fix**: A bug fix (e.g., `fix(python): corrected sorting algorithm`).
- **docs**: Documentation changes (e.g., `docs: updated README.md`).
- **style**: Code style changes (e.g., `style(python): formatted code`).
- **refactor**: Refactoring existing code (e.g., `refactor(datastructures): optimized linked list implementation`).
- **test**: Adding or updating tests (e.g., `test(web): added unit test for form validation`).
- **chore**: Routine tasks or maintenance (e.g., `chore: cleaned up unused imports`).

### 3. **Commit Message Example**:
- **Good**: `feat(python): implemented binary search algorithm`


### 4. **Conventional Commit Messages**:
- Keep messages concise but descriptive enough to explain what was changed and why.
- Use present tense and imperative mood (e.g., `fix bug` instead of `fixed a bug`).
- Start with a capital letter but avoid ending with a period.
