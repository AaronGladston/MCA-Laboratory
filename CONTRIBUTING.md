# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! To keep our codebase clean and organized, please follow these guidelines when committing changes.

## âœ… Commit Message Guidelines

To maintain a consistent and readable history of changes, please follow these conventions for your commit messages:

### 1. **Commit Message Structure**

- **type**: A short descriptor of the commit (e.g., `fix`, `feature`, `docs`, `refactor`, etc.).
- **scope**: A general label for the part of the project affected (e.g., `web`, `python`, `datastructures`, etc.). This part is optional but recommended for better clarity.
- **message**: A brief explanation of the changes made.

### 2. **Commit Types**

Please use the following types for your commits:

- [ ] **feat**: For new features (e.g., `feat(web): added contact form`)
- [ ] **fix**: For bug fixes (e.g., `fix(python): corrected sorting algorithm`)
- [ ] **docs**: For documentation changes (e.g., `docs: updated README.md`)
- [ ] **style**: For code style changes (e.g., `style(python): formatted code`)
- [ ] **refactor**: For code refactoring (e.g., `refactor(datastructures): optimized linked list implementation`)
- [ ] **test**: For adding or updating tests (e.g., `test(web): added unit test for form validation`)
- [ ] **chore**: For routine tasks or maintenance (e.g., `chore: cleaned up unused imports`)

### 3. **Commit Message Example**

- **Good**: `feat(python): implemented binary search algorithm`

### 4. **Conventional Commit Messages**

- Keep messages concise but descriptive enough to explain what was changed and why.
- Use present tense and imperative mood (e.g., `fix bug` instead of `fixed a bug`).
- Start with a capital letter but avoid ending with a period.
